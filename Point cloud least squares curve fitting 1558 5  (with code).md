#  I. Introduction 

>  The approximate method of using the least squares method (point cloud least squares method to fit the plane) has been introduced before, and I will not go into details here. Here we use the same method to fit a curve, and the fitting equation is:

>  The fitting effect here is not very ideal. It may be that the least squares method has received noise interference. Let's study it later.
