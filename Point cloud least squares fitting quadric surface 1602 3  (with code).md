#  I. Introduction 

>  Because the least squares method has been used many times before, for details, please refer to the article Point Cloud Least Squares Fitting Plane, which will not be described in detail here. For quadric surfaces, the general equation can be written as: 

>  among them 

          x 

          , 

          y 

         x,y 

     X and y are all known numbers, so this form of equation is easy to solve for the correlation coefficients using the least squares method. For details, please refer to the code below.
