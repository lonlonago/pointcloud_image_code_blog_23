#  I. Introduction 

>  Here we will no longer carry out the derivation process of the formula, because in the previous article, the point cloud least squares fitting space straight line has been related to the derivation, although it is a three-dimensional space straight line, but because it is a point-oriented relationship, the derivation process is still applicable to two-dimensional or even higher dimensions, so you can use the final conclusion of this article to fit a two-dimensional straight line, that is, the center of mass + the first eigenvector is the best fit straight line.
