#  I. Introduction 

>  Bounding box is an algorithm for solving the optimal bounding space of discrete point sets. The basic idea is to replace complex geometric objects approximately with geometric bodies (called bounding boxes) that are slightly larger in size and have simple characteristics. (From Baidu) The commonly used algorithms for solving bounding boxes mainly include AABB and OOB algorithms, but the AABB algorithm is easily affected by the orientation of objects, resulting in large gaps. Therefore, this paper will use the idea of OOB algorithm to achieve the minimum bounding box. There are many applications of bounding boxes, such as mechanical collision testing, object recognition and positioning, etc. Many scholars have used them in various fields.

     Omega space, to obtain the most value of the six points to construct the bounding box, and then the bounding box coordinates are re-projected to the original coordinate system to obtain the original data source along the main direction of the minimum bounding box.
